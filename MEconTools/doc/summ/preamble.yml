  description: |
    Given an NDarray matrix with N1, N2, ..., ND dimensions. Generate average and standard deviation for the 3rd dimension, grouping by the other dimensions.
    For example, show the 5th dimension as the column groups, and the other variables generate combinations shown as rows.
    The resulting summary statistics table contains mean and standard deviation among other statistics over the policy or value contained in the ND array.
